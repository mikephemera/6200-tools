# Python test clients for Getfile client wire protocol:

## Installing python
```apt-get install python3```

## Testing Server

After running your server, you can run
```python3 ./gftestclient.py 5```
If you don't pass command line argument, default option tested would be 2


## Testing Client

```python3 ./gftestserver.py 3```
If you don't pass command line argument, default option tested would be 1


# Java test client for Multithreaded Getfile threading:

This test only sends invalid paths and does not validate the filename. The server should just return File Not Found.

## Installing Java
```apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk```

## Building
```make```

## Running
```java -classpath ./classes/ edu.gatech.gios.MtgfTestClient number-of-workers min-delay max-delay```

Delays in milliseconds.

Example: A slow test for single-threaded operation:
```java -classpath ./classes/ edu.gatech.gios.MtgfTestClient 1 1000 1000```

Example: Stress test:
```java -classpath ./classes/ edu.gatech.gios.MtgfTestClient 1000 10 10```

# Workload generator:

The workload generator is a simple way of creating `workload.txt`, `content.txt`, and some files. This allows testing of multithreading clients and servers.
Note that the current `workload.c` only supports 100 lines.

```python3 ./gfworkload.py```

# IPC Stress Test

```python3 ./ipcstress.py /path/to/project/cache test-name```

Current tests:

`base` - the baseline test, get this to work first

`stress` - stress with an increasing number of threads but fixed parameters

`soak` - run for a long time with a fixed number of threads

`parameter` - tries variations on the parameters

# DFS Stress Test

```python3 ./dfsstress.py number-of-test-files /path/to/server/mount /path/to/client1/mount [/path/to/client2/mount...]```
